### Hello traveller!

My name's Ben White-Horne and I like making computers do interesting things quickly.

This is my personal website where I gather all my projects, ideas, etc. in one place for anyone to
peruse at their leisure.  It is entirely my own work, from the content/projects right down to the
icons and web design.

The content in this site largely follows my personal interests and hobbies.  It is mainly devoted
to programming in various languages (mostly Rust), but other than computing I usually occupy myself
with [**change ringing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_ringing), a very mathematical and
largely secular way of ringing church bells that is pretty much exclusive to England.
Change ringing also features quite heavily in this site, since there is a nice amount of
intersection between maths/computing and the theory of change ringing.

I currently work at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com) (of MATLAB fame), and before that I
studied Computer Science at St Anne's College, Oxford (with the other beavers).  On the internet I'm
usually known as 'Kneasle', and I sometimes livestream coding on
[my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKl0T4IDZC3vUz152hDAzGw) of the same name -
you'd be very welcome to come and chill out while we build crazy projects.

I also play trombone and drums and produce funky/dancy electronic music.  My recent music is on
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5se1gPrgyw8RP1cX4tRABi) (amongst other places).  Earlier
music remains on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKl0T4IDZC3vUz152hDAzGw) and
[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/kneasle) as an archive for those who want to listen to it.
