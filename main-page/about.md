Hello!  I'm Ben White-Horne, and I'm a sofware developer based in Cambridge, UK.  During the day, I
work at [MathWorks](https://mathworks.com/) (of MATLAB fame) working mostly in C++.  Before this,
I studied Computer Science at St Anne's College, Oxford.

Outside of work, I often work on coding projects (such as this site) using whatever tech best suits
the project.  Many of these projects (like [Wheatley](https://github.com/kneasle/wheatley) and
[Monument](https://github.com/kneasle/ringing/tree/master/monument)) are in production use and are
relied on by many users.  [Sapling](https://github.com/kneasle/sapling), a prototype code editor,
has over 400 stars on GitHub.  I've also contributed to larger open source projects, such as
[the Rust language](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/7640).

This is my personal website, and it chronicles many of the passion projects I've worked on over the
years, shown in <strong class="category-project use-category-color">blue boxes</strong>.  There are also
a few blog posts, shown in <strong class="category-blog use-category-color">yellow boxes</strong>.

My vision for this site required more flexibility than existing tools would allow, so this site is built
entirely from scratch.  Thus, from the content and web design, right down to the HTML/CSS/JS and a
custom site generator:

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
  <strong style="color: #fff;">Everything here is my own work.</strong>
