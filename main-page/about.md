Hello!  I'm Ben White-Horne, and I'm a sofware developer based in Cambridge, UK.  During the day, I
work at [MathWorks](https://mathworks.com/) (of MATLAB fame), mostly working in C++.  Before that,
I studied Computer Science at St Anne's College, Oxford.

Outside of work, I often work on coding projects (such as this site), using whatever tech best suits
the project.  Many of these projects ([Wheatley](https://github.com/kneasle/wheatley) and
[Monument](https://github.com/kneasle/ringing/tree/master/monument)) are in production use and are
relied on by many users.  [Sapling](https://github.com/kneasle/sapling), a prototype code editor,
has over 400 stars on GitHub.

The source code for these projects are all available [on GitHub](https://github.com/kneasle), and
I've also contributed to larger open source projects, such as
[the Rust language](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/7640).

This is my personal website, and it chronicles many of the passion projects I've worked on over the
years, shown in <strong style="color: var(--project-color);">blue boxes</strong>.  There are also
a few blog posts, shown in <strong style="color: var(--blog-color);">yellow boxes</strong>.

The vision I had required more flexibility than existing tools would allow, so this site is built
entirely from scratch.  Thus, <strong style="color: var(--blog-color);">everything here is my own
work</strong> - from the content and web design, right down to the implementation and a custom site
generator.  Even the code scrolling in the site header comes from my projects on GitHub.

<!--
The vision I had of the site required more flexibility than existing tools (CSS libraries,
static site generators, etc.) would allow, so this is built entirely from scratch in straight
HTML, CSS and a sprinkling of TypeScript.  The site is rendered from Markdown and templates using a
custom build script, using TypeScript and Deno.
