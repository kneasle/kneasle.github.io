Hello!  I'm Ben White-Horne, and I'm a sofware developer based in Cambridge, UK.  During the day, I
work at [MathWorks](https://mathworks.com/) (of MATLAB fame) working mostly in C++.  Before this,
I studied Computer Science at St Anne's College, Oxford.

Outside of work, I often work on coding projects (such as this site) using whatever tech best suits
the project.  Many of these projects (like [Wheatley](https://github.com/kneasle/wheatley) and
[Monument](https://github.com/kneasle/ringing/tree/master/monument)) are in production use and are
relied on by many users.  [Sapling](https://github.com/kneasle/sapling), a prototype code editor,
has nearly 700 stars on GitHub and has [been featured](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39253798)
on the front page of Hacker News.  I've also contributed to larger open source projects, such as
[the Rust language](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/7640).
