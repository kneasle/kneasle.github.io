    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>So, turns out I've made a blog after all.  I've been meaning to start writing stuff for a while, but
with one thing and another I never wrote anything I really felt was worth publishing.  I do <em>a lot</em>
of things, after all, and I only have 24 hours per day (and it's highly recommended that at least 8
of those are sleep - I've been there, gone there, done it.  0/10, would not recommend to a friend).</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Anyway, I've decided to just push the boat out and start writing.  After all, the only way to get
good at something is
<a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/80-of-success-is-showing-up">to actually do it</a>.  So, here we are:
I'm gonna write about whatever I feel like writing about, and you seem to be reading it :)</p>
<p>Let's see what happens. No guarantees about when I'll publish posts, or what it'll be about.  But
hopefully there'll be enough variety that you'll find something interesting.</p>
<p>Until next time, enjoy!</p>
