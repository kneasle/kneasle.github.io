**This site** is my personal website.  Everything - content, icons, CSS/web design, etc. - is made
from scratch by me.  All pages are completely static HTML, with no javascript and the bare minimum
CSS.  I'm using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) to simplify site generation and this site is hosted
using GitHub pages.
