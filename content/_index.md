### Hello traveller!

You've stumbled across my website - what a great place to find yourself!  This is where I gather
all my projects, ideas, etc. in one place for anyone to peruse at their leisure.  It is entirely my
own work, from the content/projects right down to the icons and web design.

### Let me introduce myself...

My name's Ben White-Horne and I'm in my 4<sup>th</sup> year studying Computer Science at
Oxford University (at St Anne's college, along with the other beavers).  On the internet I'm
usually known as 'Kneasle', and I sometimes livestream coding on [my YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKl0T4IDZC3vUz152hDAzGw) of the same name - you'd be very
welcome to come and chill out while we build crazy projects.

This website is mainly devoted to programming in various languages (mostly Rust), but other than
computing I usually occupy myself with [**change
ringing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_ringing), a mathematical and largely secular way of
ringing church bells that is pretty much exclusive to England.  Change ringing also features quite
heavily in this site, since there is a nice amount of intersection between maths/computing and the
theory of change ringing.

I also play trombone and drums and produce funky/dancy electronic music.  My recent music is on
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5se1gPrgyw8RP1cX4tRABi) (amongst other places).  Earlier
music remains on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKl0T4IDZC3vUz152hDAzGw) and
[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/kneasle) as an archive for those who want to listen to it.
